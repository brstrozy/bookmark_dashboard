# Bookmark Dashboard

Simple dashboard to display bookmarks from given URLs.

# Configuration:

example_bookmarks.js is loaded by default, but you can add your own bookmarks by adding a file called `bookmarks.js` in the same directory as the dashboard.

```
cp example_bookmarks.js bookmarks.js
```

'bookmarks.js' is not tracked by git to avoid overwriting your personal bookmarks on git pull.
